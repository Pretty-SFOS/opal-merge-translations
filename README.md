# Translations merger

This tool can merge Qt translations catalogs. It is intended as an eventual
replacement for the Bash script [opal-merge-translations.sh](https://github.com/Pretty-SFOS/opal/blob/main/snippets/opal-merge-translations.sh)
currently in use in Opal.


## Project status

This tool is usable and stable but it requires
[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc). To be
included in Opal by default, it should be reworked to use only the Python
standard library.
